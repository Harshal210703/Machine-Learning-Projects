## [Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR)]([Handwriting Text Recognition](https://github.com/Harshal210703/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Handwriting%20Text%20Recognition))

**Introduction:** This project first delves into the foundational models that have historically been used for Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR). We explore the core principles behind Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to lay the groundwork for understanding a more advanced technique.

**Articles:** A series of articles exploring the fundamentals of Handwriting Text Recognition:
